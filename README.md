# Developing-a-GAN-for-Synthetic-Market-Price-Data-to-Test-Algorithmic-Trading-Strategies
Develop a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic market price data for testing new algorithmic trading strategies.

# Goal: 
Generate synthetic stock price data that resembles real market data to test algorithmic trading strategies.

# Key Metrics:
Quality of synthetic data (e.g., statistical similarity to real data).
Performance of trading strategies on synthetic vs. real data.
